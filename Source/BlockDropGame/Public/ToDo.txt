Glitches/Issues:


* The camera and block dropper have gone too high after about 25 blocks: the rate at which they rise should be relative to each block's size.
* Game doesn't fail when blocks fall off the tower (solve this with a volume whose overlap detects falling blocks).
* Game doesn't fail when blocks touch a block then touch a non-block actor 
	(solve this by only letting them "relax" when they've touched the first block).

=================================================================================================================================================

Basic ToDos here only:


# The shrinking collectable should destroy when its scale is about 0.02 (anything else is too long)
# Shrinking collectable needs a sound for when it's missed.
# Shrinking collectable needs a sound for when it's collected.
# Simplify the pipeline for adding new means of scoring: maybe the game mode could own instances of structs relating to that kind of thing?
# UX flow: Go to an ugly high score screen on losing.
# Save a high score and display it on the score hud. If it's empty, display 0.

=================================================================================================================================================

Extra polish:


@ Quick particle when shrinking collectable destructs
@ Place collectables above and left/right of the top block to incentivise tricky play :)
@ Blocks should change colour for every few placed
@ Add music
@ Start thinking about art: draw some quick and awful concepts to demonstrate basic plans for graphics,
	so I can have an idea about an asset list

=================================================================================================================================================

Far future polish, low priority:


? Different game modes, which hold a difficulty struct
? Extremely difficult mode, featuring super wobbly tower 
? Skins/shop
? "Good"/"perfect": give extra score for accuracy. However this might conflict with the collectables which require you to
	go sideways to collect them.

=================================================================================================================================================

Code: Design & Optimisations:


` FAKE DESTROY: for collectables, the ability to fake destroy would surely help ( set their visibility to 0, their translation to (0,1000, 0)
	and disable tick.
` Consider using delegates and the message bus, to avoid duplication of code by the IGameStateNotifier class
` Solve design problem: why does the game mode know about the block dropper? It should talk to it via communication with the pawn class
` After a certain amount of time, or another button has been pressed, ABlockDropPawn::bPlayerRequestedQuitGame must be reset to false.
` Blocks which are allowed to permanently stop simulating physics should be batched as (maybe hierarchical) instanced static meshes
` Store the number of blocks currently simulating physics and clamp it by the max number of blocks which can simulate physics
