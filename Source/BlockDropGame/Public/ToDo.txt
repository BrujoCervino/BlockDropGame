Glitches/Issues:


* The camera and block dropper have gone too high after about 25 blocks: the rate at which they rise should be relative to each block's size.
* Game doesn't fail when blocks fall off the tower (solve this with a volume whose overlap detects falling blocks).
* Game doesn't fail when blocks touch a block then touch a non-block actor 
	(solve this by only letting them "relax" when they've touched the first block).

=================================================================================================================================================

Basic ToDos here only:


# Consider using delegates and the message bus, to avoid duplication of code by the IGameStateNotifier class
# Solve design problem: why does the game mode know about the block dropper? It should talk to it via communication with the pawn class
# After a certain amount of time, or another button has been pressed, ABlockDropPawn::bPlayerRequestedQuitGame must be reset to false.

Extra polish:

@ Blocks should change colour for every few placed
@ Add music
@ Add a quit to menu button
@ Add a quit app button
@ Store the number of blocks currently simulating physics and clamp it by the max number of blocks which can simulate physics
@ Start thinking about art: draw some quick and awful concepts to demonstrate basic plans for graphics,
	so I can have an idea about an asset list

=================================================================================================================================================


Far future polish, low priority:

? Different game modes, which hold a difficulty struct
? Extremely difficult mode, featuring super wobbly tower
? Blocks which are allowed to permanently stop simulating physics should be batched as (maybe hierarchical) instanced static meshes
